This is a sample text file for testing the RAG system.

The system should:
1. Read this file
2. Split it into chunks
3. Generate embeddings for each chunk
4. Store the chunks and embeddings in the database

This demonstrates the basic functionality of:
- File reading
- Text chunking
- Embedding generation
- Database storage

You can use either the mock embedder for testing or OpenAI's embedder for production use.
