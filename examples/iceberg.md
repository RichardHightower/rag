# Apache Iceberg and Glue integration for versioning

Apache Iceberg handles versioning in AWS Glue through its integration with the AWS Glue Catalog and its support for transactional operations. Here are the key aspects of how versioning is managed:

### **1. Table Versions in the AWS Glue Catalog**

- In Iceberg, when using AWS Glue as the catalog implementation, every version of an Iceberg table is stored as a **Glue TableVersion**. This allows users to track changes to the table over time and manage historical versions effectively[1][4].
- The Glue Catalog stores Iceberg namespaces as Glue Databases and Iceberg tables as Glue Tables, ensuring seamless integration with AWS Glue's metadata management[1][4].

### **2. Time Travel and Rollbacks**

- Iceberg supports **time travel** queries, enabling users to read specific historical versions of a table based on snapshots managed by Iceberg. This feature allows users to access data as it existed at a particular point in time[2].
- Users can also perform **rollbacks**, reverting a table to a previous version if needed, which is particularly useful for recovering from unintended changes or errors[2].

### **3. Optimistic Locking for Version Control**

- Iceberg employs **optimistic locking** to ensure atomic transactions and prevent conflicts during concurrent updates. Each table has a version ID recorded when metadata is retrieved. Updates are allowed only if the version ID remains unchanged, ensuring no conflicting changes have occurred[1][4].
- If a conflict arises, Iceberg refreshes the metadata and retries the operation if no further conflicts exist. This mechanism guarantees consistency and prevents accidental overwrites of changes[1][4].

### **4. Archival of Older Table Versions**

- By default, the Iceberg Glue Catalog skips archiving older table versions to optimize performance and reduce storage overhead. However, users can enable archival by setting `glue.skip-archive` to `false`, allowing them to retain older versions for recovery or auditing purposes[4].

### **5. Snapshot Management**

- Iceberg manages snapshots of table data, which serve as the basis for versioning. These snapshots track changes such as additions, deletions, and updates at a granular level, enabling efficient version control and query performance[2].

In summary, Apache Iceberg's integration with AWS Glue provides robust versioning capabilities through Glue TableVersions, time travel queries, rollbacks, optimistic locking, and snapshot management. These features make it well-suited for managing transactional data lakes with strong consistency and historical data tracking.

# **Can you provide an example of creating an Iceberg table in AWS Glue?**

Here is an example of creating an Apache Iceberg table in AWS Glue using Spark SQL. This example demonstrates how to write data to an Iceberg table stored in Amazon S3 and register it in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.

### **Prerequisites**

1. Ensure you are using AWS Glue version 3.0 or later, as it natively supports Iceberg.
2. Grant the necessary permissions to your AWS Glue job IAM role, including access to the S3 bucket and AWS Glue Data Catalog.
3. Configure the `-datalake-formats` parameter to include `iceberg` when setting up your Glue job.

---

### **Steps to Create an Iceberg Table**

### **1. Write Data to an Iceberg Table**

The following Python code uses Spark SQL to create an Iceberg table:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Initialize Spark session
spark = SparkSession.builder \\
    .appName("IcebergTableCreation") \\
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog", "org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog") \\
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog.warehouse", "s3://<your-s3-bucket>/warehouse/") \\
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog.catalog-impl", "org.apache.iceberg.aws.glue.GlueCatalog") \\
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog.io-impl", "org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO") \\
    .getOrCreate()

# Create a temporary view from a DataFrame
data = [(1, "Alice"), (2, "Bob"), (3, "Charlie")]
columns = ["id", "name"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)
df.createOrReplaceTempView("tmp_table")

# Define and execute the SQL query to create the Iceberg table
query = """
CREATE TABLE glue_catalog.<your_database_name>.<your_table_name>
USING iceberg
AS SELECT * FROM tmp_table
"""
spark.sql(query)

```

- Replace `<your-s3-bucket>` with the name of your S3 bucket.
- Replace `<your_database_name>` and `<your_table_name>` with your desired database and table names in the Glue Data Catalog.

### **2. Register the Table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog**

When the above query executes, it automatically registers the Iceberg table in the AWS Glue Data Catalog under the specified database (`<your_database_name>`). The table metadata, including schema and location, is stored in the catalog.

---

### **Verify Table Creation**

1. Navigate to the AWS Glue Console.
2. Check that the new database (`<your_database_name>`) and table (`<your_table_name>`) are listed in the Data Catalog.
3. Confirm that the actual data and metadata files are stored in your specified S3 location.

---

### **Additional Notes**

- You can also create Iceberg tables manually using the AWS Glue `CreateTable` API if needed.
- For advanced configurations, such as enabling time travel or partitioning, you can modify the SQL query or use additional Iceberg APIs.

This approach allows you to leverage Iceberg's advanced features like ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel while seamlessly integrating with AWS Glue for ETL workflows[1][2].
